# Spam-email-classification-RandomForest-GradientBoosting
This creates a classifier model that classifies the emails/messages in spam and ham category. Our goal is to categorize the mails as spam and predict what future mails are going to be spam. We have used Bagging and Boosting Ensemble Technique: Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
